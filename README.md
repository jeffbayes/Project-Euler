Hi, and welcome to my Project Euler solutions!

I just started this early in January of 2014, so I'm not too far along. Between school work and paid work,
this will probably come along slowly, but I want to practice posting to GitHub, forcing myself to write
clean code on a regular basis, and challenge my own problem solving skills in order to complete as many
of the questions posed in Project Euler. Please, take a look at my solutions and if you have any critiques
on the way I wrote the code, I'm always listening.

Currently completed:
# 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
